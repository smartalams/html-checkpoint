<br>
<p>There are three main types of IT security controls including <strong><em>technical, administrative, and physical.</em></strong> The primary goal for implementing a security control can be preventative, detective, corrective, compensatory, or act as a deterrent.

</p>
<br>
     <h3>Types Of Security control</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Techinal Security Contol</li>
        <li>Administrative Security Control</li>
        <li>Management Security Control</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>TECHICAL SECURITY CONTROL</h3>
    <p>Technical controls use  technology as a basis for controlling the access and usage of sensitive data throughout a physical structure and over a network. Technical controls are far-reaching in scope and encompass such technologies as:
    </p>
    
             <ul>
                <li>Encryption</li>
                <li>Smart cards</li>
                <li>Network Authentification</li>
                <li>Acess Control lists(ACL)</li>
                <li>File Intergrity Auditing Software</li>
             </ul> 
             <br>        
    <h3> Administrative Control System</h3>
     <b><p style="color: green"> <strong>Administrative</strong> controls are a type of hazard control. They are used to improve safety within the workplace by putting in place policies and rules that reduce the occupational risk faced by workers via altering the way their work is performed.   
    ntrols include implementing policies, rules, and schedules that support safety, as well as setting safe operating procedures and standards (such as <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu" target="_blank"><strong>training</strong></a> 
    criteria, housekeeping duties, and maintenance practices) reduce exposure to hazardous substances and dangerous tasks</p></b>
       <h4>Management Security Control</h4>
       <P><srtrong>Management</srtrong> security is the overall design of your controls. Sometimes referred to as  administrative control, these provide the guidance, rules, and procedures for implementing a security environment</P>
       <br>
       <h1> The access control system</h1>
       <br>
       <b><em><P style="color: blue"><u>Access control systems</u> are an important part of an overall security program that is designed to deter and reduce both criminal behavior and violations of an organization security policies. But it is important to remember that it is only a part.

        First, it is important to understand that access control is not an element of security; it is a concession that security programs make to daily operational necessities. Perfect security involves perfect access control. By that, I mean that in a perfect security environment, not one person can enter who is not absolutely known without question to be an ardent supporter of the security portion of the overall mission of the organization. In a real organization, this virtually never happens. Access control systems are an automated method to allow friendlies to enter controlled, restricted, and secured areas of a facility with only minimal vetting at the access control portal. Indeed, access control portals are doorways through a security perimeter in which the entrants are assumed to be friendly, due to their status as an employee, contractor, or softly vetted visitor.</P></b></em>
